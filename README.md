# Excel-Dashboard


## What the project does
This project utilizes Excel to analyze data from a dataset and generate a comprehensive dashboard specifically focused on bike sales. The primary objective of the project is to provide insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making related to bike sales. The project achieves this by utilizing pivot tables, which allow for summarizing and aggregating the dataset in various ways. Additionally, slicers are employed to provide an interactive filtering mechanism for the dashboard. This functionality enhances the usability and flexibility of the dashboard, enabling users to explore different aspects of the bike sales data easily.
## Why the project is useful
